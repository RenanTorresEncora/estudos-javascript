Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds a value to the group

from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean value 
indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.

Use the === operator, or something equivalent such as indexOf,

object as argument and creates a group that contains all the 
values produced by iterating over it.

Symbol.iterator method on the array. That would work,

It is okay if your iterator behaves strangely when the

method anymore because the object’s own property hides the method value.

Can you think of a way to call hasOwnProperty on an object that has
